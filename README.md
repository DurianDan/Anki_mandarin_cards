In this project, i try to export elements of mandarin words into a JSON (then import it into Anki - a flashcard software)
This is python packages that i use:
* selenium (to get text information from website)(it would be better to use API but the websites that i search is not developer-friendly)
* googletrans (to translate complicated words or phrase that doesn't appear in the dictionaty websites)
* gtts (to export pronunciation of the word into mp3 file)
* urllib.request (to download stroke order in gif format)
